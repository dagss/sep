Overview
--------

Often Python extensions needs to communicate things on the ABI level
about Python objects. In essence, one would like more slots in
``PyTypeObject`` for a custom purpose. Dictionary lookups are both
impractical, slow, and require the GIL.

The solution today is often to rely on
``PyObject_TypeCheck``. However, this works against standardizing
things across libraries, and creates one-to-many situations (only one
implementor of an API, but many consumers), rather than many-to-many
where there can be multiple implementors and multiple consumers of a
mutually agreed-upon standard (think "domain-specific PEP 3118s").

To overcome this problem, the usual approach is to propose a
PEP. However, that process is a) slow, b) not suitable for very
domain-specific tasks, and c) the result is not backwards-compatible
with earlier versions of Python.

This SEP introduces a metaclass on the C level which can be used to
provide effectively an unlimited number of custom slots in the
``PyTypeObject``, without relying on the normal type inheritance.

Examples uses:

 * Make the NumPy array truly polymorphic at the C level, exporting
   various vtables

 * Implement "fast callables" on the C-level, so that, e.g., Cython
   can call ``np.sin`` from C code with very little overhead, because
   it finds a function pointer with a "dd->d" signature tagged to the
   Python object

 * Standardize the Cython ``cdef class`` vtable

 * Standardize the internal memoryview representation of Cython
   (which is much faster than passing around ``Py_buffer``)


Implementation and lack of runtime dependency
---------------------------------------------

An implementation of the metaclass is available from
https://github.com/dagss/pyextensibletype

Having a run-time dependency would be a significant disadvantage.
Instead, each participating library should contain the code for the
``extensibletype`` metaclass, provided in a short header file
(``include/extensibletype.h``). Because one needs to compare the
metaclass by reference, each library always checks a central location
for it::

    try:
        extensibletype = sys.modules.setdefault('_extensibletype', {})['extensibletype-v1']
        # succeeded, ignore our own implementation of it
    except KeyError:
        # create it and insert it


The custom slot table
---------------------

The metaclass is used to annotate each participating type with a table
of custom slots::

    typedef struct {
        unsigned long id;
        void *data;
    } PyCustomSlot;

The ``id`` identifies the purpose of the slot and the ID space is
described further down.  Users querying an object for a C-level
interface scan this custom slot table in its type for IDs they
recognize. If an entry is found, ``data`` contains custom information
(defined by whoever defined the ID). It will often be a pointer to a
vtable, similar to slots like ``tp_as_buffer``, but alternatively it
can be casted to an integer representing an offset that should be
added to the ``PyObject*`` of instances of the type in order to look
up some field.

Custom slots are not required to have any order; types are expected to
know which custom slot is most performance critical and put that first
in the list.

Note, however, that a custom slot definition can say that it expects
to be found after a given location. For instance, if the NumPy array
grows four different C vtables, then the last one can indicate that it
should always be found as the 4th slot or later on any type, so that
users can optimize for the common case of NumPy arrays. Other less
featureful array types would then need to pre-pad the table to expose
the slot. (This scheme should mean there's almost never branch misses
for "typical" types; a "callable array" could however cause branch
misses.)


Consumer API
------------

The consumer API is meant to be forwards-compatible with other ways of
implementing the same concepts (like a PEP), and so doesn't mention the
metaclass explicitly.

All functions except the first can be called without holding the GIL,
as long as you have a guaranteed reference to the type object.

``PyCustomSlots_Init()``
    **Always** call this function before any other
    function, typically during module initialization.
    As the function sets a static global variable defined in the header
    file, this must be called *within every compilation unit*.

    For now, this is the same as ``PyExtensibleType_Import`` below,
    but if the mechanism changes (e.g. to a PEP) in the future this
    could be made a no-op.


``PyCustomSlots_Check(obj)``
    Does the object support the protocol? Should be checked before using
    any of the other below.

``PyCustomSlots_Count(obj)``
    How many custom slots does the object support?

``PyCustomSlot *PyCustomSlots_Table(obj)``
    Get a pointer to the table

``PyCustomSlot *PyCustomSlots_Find(PyObject *obj, unsigned long id, unsigned long mask)``
    Search the table for a matching slot; returns ``NULL`` if none is found.
    The comparison happens ``&`` the given mask (the ID can also contain flags
    in some of the bits).

Provider API
------------

To annotate a type with custom slots, basically read the metaclass
source code and understand it. What changes is the definition of
the type object; the basic steps are:

 * Make the type object a ``PyHeapExtensibleTypeObject``. This is
   a "substruct" of ``PyHeapTypeObject`` rather than ``PyTypeObject``.
   This changes the initialization a little bit but was needed to make
   types subclassable Python side.

 * Set the metaclass (``ob_type`` in the type object)

 * Set ``etp_count`` and ``etp_custom_slots`` to the custom slot table

Relevant snippet from ``demo/provider_c_code.h``::

    PyTypeObject *extensibletype = PyExtensibleType_Import();
    if (!extensibletype) return -1;
    ((PyObject*)&Provider_Type)->ob_type = extensibletype;
    Provider_Type.etp_count = 1;
    Provider_Type.etp_custom_slots = my_custom_slots;


Subclasses
----------

C subclasses must be explicit and care for themselves; we can't make
``PyType_Ready`` magically know about this.

If you subclass a type Python-side ("on the heap"), the metaclass
``tp_new`` kicks in and copies the pointer to the table from the
parent type. This behaviour is coded into the metaclass and is thus
hard to change; but of course code can undo this (with the aid of some
C-level helpers) after the metaclass ``tp_new`` has run.

Benchmark results
-----------------

The penalty of a branch-predicted table lookup in a micro-benchmark
was 1.08 ns on a 1.87 GHz (Intel Core i7 Q 840).

Changing to a format where the table was embedded directly, loosing
one pointer indirection, did not change the numbers at all.  Also,
because the var-object resizeability is already used up for the method
table in heap-allocated types, this would be somewhat intricated.


The custom slot ID space
------------------------

The ``unsigned long`` is expected to be at least 32 bits.

The most significant 8 bits (of a 32 bit uint) denote a
"registrar". Each registrar determines the use of the remaining 24
bits, but a recommendation, from most to least significant, is:

 * 8 bits: Registrar (required)
 * 8 bits: Which custom slot "idea"
 * 8 bits: Which backwards-incompatible version of the idea
 * 8 bits: Flags for backwards-compatible changes (like appending to the end
   of a vtable)

When lookup up a slot following this recommendation, one should
therefore ``&`` the ID with the proper mask for the flags,
which is the purpose of the ``mask`` argument to ``PyCustomSlots_Find``
(that is, to match any flags, pass ``0xffffff00``).

Special IDs:

 * 0x00000000: Reserved for now
 * 0x00000001: Use if pre-padding table is needed

ID space (most significant 8 bits):

 * 0x00: Reserved
 * 0x01-0x0f: For internal/personal use, never use in released libraries
 * 0x10-0x6f: NumFOCUS SEPs, NumPy, SciPy
 * 0x70-0x7f: Cython
 * 0x80-...: Whoever asks


Discussion
----------

The metaclass approach might be somewhat less elegant on the C level than
various other approaches, like hijacking a bit in the flags. However, a
metaclass is much safer with respect .

One are also not able to use metaclasses for other purposes. The author
is not aware of any usecases for metaclasses for type implemented in C;
if such usecases exists, one could support it by checking the entire
metaclass hierarchy (check ``tp_base`` on the metaclass).

As for inclusion as a PEP, that only works for new Python versions.
Python-dev was consulted on the question [#]_, and Nick Coghlan's
response [#]_ indicated that a PEP might not be entirely impossible
but should require a working implementation based on meta-classes
first.
